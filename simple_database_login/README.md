# Easy Peasy Login Experiment

##Simple Login, Sqlite3##
Wanted to write a very simple login against sqlite3 with Go.

##Demonstrates the following##
* Basic password hashing using sha256
* User lookup from the database
* Methods Get/Post
* Variable use of Go's html templates.

##What it doesn't do##
* Status Messages. A lot of this stuff should go back to the login form, rather than an ugly error page. It doesn't.
* Sessions. Didn't have time for sessions in this build. I'll do that in the next one.
* Basic Security. None here. Don't try this in production.

Hoping this makes sense to PHP programmers.
