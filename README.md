#Dog Simple Golang Experiments

Welcome to my Golang Experimental Repo! You’ve made it! 


Here, you’ll find some dog simple examples that’ll get you up and running in Go. Or, at least, perhaps, something a php programmer can wrap his head around. 


Not really sure what else to say about it right now. 


Go is a fantastic programming language, and it’s a lot of fun to write. But, while it’s pretty easy to learn, it can seem daunting for the uninitiated. This repo is my attempt at demonstrating some simple idiomatic Go.


The experiments, as I post them, will build on each other, and hopefully provide and easy “how did Tin do that?” reference point.


And that’s that.


Have fun!
